# ðŸ§± COMPONENTS

This directory contains our React.js components.

In short, any reusable UI element should be a component. This includes form fields, buttons, icons, etc.

## ðŸ§¶ NOTE

- If you are dealing with a component that is not reusable, it is probably not a component. It is probably a page.
- If you are dealing with a complex page, it is probably composed of components.
- If you are dealing with a complex component that is composed of other components, it is probably better created a folder for, and put the component and its children components in it.
