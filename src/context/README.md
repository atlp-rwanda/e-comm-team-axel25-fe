# ðŸª¡ CONTEXT

The context is a set of data that is passed to the `render` function of a component. It is used to pass data to the component, and to communicate with the component.

For example, the `render` function of a component can access the `theme` property of the context to know which theme is currently active.

Another example is the `render` function of a component can access the `setTheme` function of the context to change the theme.

Another context can be the `auth` context, which contains the `user` and `token` properties, and the `setUser` and `setToken` functions.
