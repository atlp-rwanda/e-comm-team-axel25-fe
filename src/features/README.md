# ðŸ§© FEATURES

This directory contains all the features of the application. Each feature is a folder with a `index.ts` file that exports the feature's reducer and a `components` folder that contains all the components of the feature.

Each separate feature should be a separate folder in this directory.

Examples of features are the `auth` feature, the `theme` feature, the `users` feature, the `products` feature, etc.

This is the recommended structure for a feature:

```text
src
â””â”€â”€ features
    â””â”€â”€ feature-name
        â”œâ”€â”€ components
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Component1.tsx
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Component2.tsx
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
        â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts
        â””â”€â”€ types.ts
```
