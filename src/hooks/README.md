# 🪝 HOOKS

Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

In this folder, you can find all the hooks used in the application.

Custom hooks can include any built in hooks such as `useState` or `useEffect`, as well as any other custom hooks, such as the `useAuth` hook, which is used to get the current user and sign in and sign out, and the `useTheme` hook, which is used to get the current theme and toggle between light and dark mode.
