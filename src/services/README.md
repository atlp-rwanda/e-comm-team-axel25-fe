# 🐕‍🦺 SERVICES

Services are responsible for the business logic of the application. They are the only place where you can use the database, the cache, the filesystem, etc.

Basically, any place where you need to do something that is not related to the UI, but deals with API calls, data fetching, data manipulation, etc. should be done in a service.
