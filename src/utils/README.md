# UTILS

The utils folder is about utility functions.

Utility functions are functions that are used in multiple places.

For example, a function that converts a date to a string.

What you need to keep in mind, is that utility functions should be pure functions,
which means that they should not have any side effects, and they should not depend on
any external variables.

In other words, utility functions should be independent of any other code.
